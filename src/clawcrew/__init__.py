ClawCrew - Multi-agent AI team framework for OpenClaw

ClawCrew coordinates specialized AI agents that collaborate on complex tasks.
Each agent has its own workspace with SOUL.md (personality) and memory/ (lessons learned).

Example usage:
    clawcrew init          # Interactive setup wizard
    clawcrew start         # Start the system
    clawcrew run code -t "implement function"  # Run an agent
    clawcrew chain "task" design code test     # Chain multiple agents
